# RadArt - Art-Hackathon Web Application Portion
The web app portion of our ArtHackathon project for the YoungArts Foundation. Our project is divided between a mobile app and web app portion. You can view the ArtHackathon mobile app [at here](https://github.com/alastairparagas/ArtHackathon-App).

## Behind the name "RadArt"
Our project is named RadArt, clever combinations and play on the crucial words "Rad", "Art", and "Radar", all being the main themes of our two-prong application. "Rad Art" symbolizes the individuality and coolness factor of local and individual art around Miami. "Radar" is a crucial functionality of the app, roughly utilizing both the app and site user's GPS coordinates to provide a seamless art discovery process.

## Features
The site will mostly be meant for advertising the app (the traditional app landing page) with a back-end/auth-guarded process for local artists to upload their art and set up bios/related artist data, as well as complementary information about their art pieces (history, accompanying information, etc). There will also be a calendar feature.

## Libraries, APIs, and tools used
* BootFlat (Flat style version of Bootstrap 3 front-end framework)
* jQuery (for DOM manipulation)
* Angular.JS (For Model-View-Logic organization)
* Firebase (NoSQL solution for live data streaming and storage on the backend. Used in place of MySQL)

* GitHub (open-source project revision system)
* Gulp (Node.js package for automating certain front-end data like SCSS to CSS conversion, Javascript documentation, linting, and so forth)
* Bower (a central front-end dependency manager for keeping dependencies structured and away from our app's logic).
